## About Me

I recently obtained a Ph.D. in Reinforcement Learning at The "Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique" ([ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/)) in Sorbonne Université (Paris), within the [MLIA team](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/mlia/). 
I am supervised by Olivier Sigaud (ISIR, Sorbonne Université) and Sylvain Lamprier (LERIA, Université d'Angers, ex MLIA Sorbonne université). 
I work on goal-conditionned Deep Reinforcement Learning in continuous environment. 
Specifically, my objective is to design intrinsically motivated agents that sets their own goals in order to explore and expand their sets of skills. 
I focus on approaches that need as little prior knowledge on the environment as possible in order to scale to unsupervised settings. 

## Research Interests

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Goal-conditionned RL, Curiculum Learning, Exploration
- **Representation Learning:** Data compression, Contrastive Learning
- **Machine Learning:** Generative models, Variational inference, Optimisation

## News
- **[May. 2025]** Check out our new preprint: [Imagine Beyond!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17830) We propose a new method to overcome exploration bottlenecks in Online RL coupled with representation learning leveraging [Distributionally Robust Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05659).  
- **[January. 2025]** I defended my PhD Thesis on the 15 January 2025. [Manuscript](https://theses.fr/2025SORUS005).
- **[July. 2023]** I am going to present our paper SVGG at ICML 2023 during a poster session in Honolulu.
- **[April. 2023]** Our paper [Stein Variational Goal Genration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06719) (SVGG) is accepted at ICML 2023. We propose a new method to automatically generate a curriculum of goals leveraging the Bayesian Inference method [Stein Variational Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04471).
