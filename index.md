## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at The "Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique" (ISIR) in Sorbonne Université, Paris. I work under the supervision of Olivier Sigaud (ISIR, Sorbonne Université) and Sylvain Lamprier (LERIA, Université d'Angers, ex MLIA Sorbonne université). I work on goal-conditionned Reinforcement Learning in continuous environment. Specifically, my objective is to design intrinsically motivated agents that sets their own goals in order to explore and expand their sets of skills. I focus on approaches that need as litle prior knowledge on the environment as possible in order to scale to unsupervised settings. 

## Research Interests

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Goal-conditionned RL, Curiculum Learning, Exploration
- **Machine Learning:** Generative models, Variational inference, Optimisation

## News

- **[April. 2023]** Our paper Stein Variational Goal Genration (SVGG) is accepted at ICML 2023 (Honolulu).
